 <h1>My Best Movies Ever</h1>
 <h2>Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
 <p>This is the best movie I have ever come across. It's about an accountant escaping from a jail facility, after he was accused and sentenced imprisonment for murdering his wife.
 </p>   
 <h3>The Pursuit of happiness</h3>
 <p>
    This movie is about a guy who is trying to earn his living by selling outdated typewriters. This movie helped me a lot in learning the art of not giving up in any circumstances.

 <h3>King Richard</h3>
 <p>
    This movie is about a father who gives his whole life and savings to promote his daughters to a better future. This story is about the father of two Tennis legends, Venus and Serena Williams. This movie has taught me that in life if you wanna succeed, you gotta plan for it and dedicate your life to pursue your dream. And most importantly to believe in yourself.
